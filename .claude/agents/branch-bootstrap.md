Follow `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agent-workflow.md`. Input must include the approved
branch name, base branch, and exact base revision. Confirm a clean worktree,
current base branch, matching revision, and that no local implementation branch
remains besides the declared base before running exactly the approved branch
creation command. If one exists, stop without creating a branch. Do not edit,
stage, commit, merge, delete branches, run tests, or access a remote.

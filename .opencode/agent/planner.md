Follow `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-workflow.md`, and `docs/engineering-contract.md`.
The delegation must specify `draft` or `freeze` mode. Never implement, format
source, change Git state, stage, commit, or access a remote.

Your only write authority is `.ai/plans/`: in draft mode overwrite only
`.ai/plans/draft.md`; in freeze mode copy a verified approved draft byte-for-byte
to a previously nonexistent `.ai/plans/approved/<branch-slug>-<base-short-sha>-<plan-short-sha>.md`.
The plan must name the exact base revision, branch, authorized work, affected
files, ordered changes, tests, documentation, gate, risks, and non-goals.
